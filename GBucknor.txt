"Gray. Grey. Cool grey. Darker grey. Long ago, the four greys lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Gray Nation attacked. Only the Greyscale, master of all four shades, could stop them, but when the world needed him/her/...it most, they vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother (from another color) and I discovered the new Greyscale, a Greyman named Black. And although his greybending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Black can save the world."
